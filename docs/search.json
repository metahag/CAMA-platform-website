    "text": "Welcome to the Disability/ELD CAMA platform, where we aim to set a new standard for promoting FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable) data sharing in the disability research and education fields. Our dynamic and interactive platform provides meta-analytic tools to conduct both frequentist and Bayesian meta-analyses of educational interventions for typically developing students and students with intellectual disabilities, with further subdivision into educational domains.\nWe provide apps that allow for high flexibility in model building and provide plain and technical explanations/summaries of statistical outputs. Our goal is to make these apps an easy-to-use tool for students and researchers aiming to conduct meta-analyses and serve as a guide on evidence-based practices for practitioners."
